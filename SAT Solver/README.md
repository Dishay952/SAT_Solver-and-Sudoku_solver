### Dishay Mehta 200341

## How to run
> Open 'SAT_Solver.cpp' and execute it.<br>
> When prompted enter the relative path of the DIMACS file along with the '.cnf' extension.<br>
> The solver will return whether the formula is unsatisfiable or not, if not, it returns a model to the formula. <br>
> <br>
> For example: If the file 'test.cnf' is present in the same directory as 'SAT_Solver.cpp', we will only enter 'test.cnf'.

## Implementation
> A brief overview of the algorithm used is explained in the 'SAT_Solver_Documentation.pdf'.

## Limitations
> Make sure the path specified does not have any spaces or special characters (except underscore).
